# Python Learning 30 Day Challenge:

## Overview
Welcome to Day 1 of our **30-Day Python Learning Challenge**! This challenge is designed to help you master Python step by step by building projects and understanding core concepts.

Today marks the beginning of an exciting journey to learn Python in just 30 days. Each day will cover specific concepts, paired with hands-on projects to reinforce learning. By the end of this challenge, you'll have a strong foundation in Python programming, alongside practical experience with Docker and real-world project development.

## Day 1: Python Basics and Docker Setup

### Objectives
1. **Understand Python Basics:**
   - Variables and data types.
   - Input/output operations.
   - Writing and executing a Python script.

2. **Introduction to Docker:**
   - What is Docker and why it's useful.
   - How to create and use a Dockerfile to containerize a Python project.

## Project: Python Calculator
### Description
We created a simple Python calculator that:
- Prompts the user to enter two numbers.
- Asks the user to choose a mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
- Performs the operation and prints the result.

The project was then containerized using Docker to ensure it runs consistently across environments.


## Next Steps
On Day 2, we'll build upon today's foundation by:
1. Introducing conditional statements and loops in Python.
2. Learning more advanced Docker concepts, such as managing volumes and environment variables.

Stay consistent and keep building! ðŸš€
